# Kaggle-cats-or-dogs-CNN-Classification


This is a practice of Convolution Neural Network using the image dataset from a Kaggle competition. The CNN models would be trained to classify the image data to cat or dog. There are plenty of different types of CNNs out in the market. I have tried VGGNET16 and normal muti-layer CNN for this practise, and the VGGNET16 model output a higher accuracy. The result of the submission is showed below.
